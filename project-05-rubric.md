Data Science Immersive | Project 5

Your project will be assessed using the following standards:

- [ ] Identify Problem
- [ ] Acquire Data
- [ ] Parse Data
- [ ] Mine Data
- [ ] Refine Data
- [ ] Model Data
- [ ] Present Results

Acceptable performance for these standards is based on how well you've performed the specific requirements listed below.

### `step_1-benchmarking.ipynb`

| Requirements | Incomplete (0) | Does Not Meet Expectations (1) | Meets Expectations (2) | Exceeds Expectations (3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Model: Build pipeline to perform a naive logistic regression as a baseline model <br> **note**: *make sure the implementation is naive i.e. `C` should be set to a large value to minimize regularization* | | | | |

| Requirements | Incomplete (0) | Does Not Meet Expectations (1) | Meets Expectations (2) | Exceeds Expectations (3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Model: Build pipeline with `LogisticRegression` using `l1` penalty  | | | | |
| Present: Use constructed model to identify important features  | | | | |

| Requirements | Incomplete (0) | Does Not Meet Expectations (1) | Meets Expectations (2) | Exceeds Expectations (3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Model: Construct a Pipeline that uses `SelectKBest` to transform data | | | | |
| Model: Construct a Pipeline that uses `LogisticRegression` to model data | | | | |
| Model: Construct a Pipeline that uses `KNearestNeighbors` to model data | | | | |
| Model: Gridsearch optimal parameters for logistic regression and kNN | | | | |
